# Reflect app

# Set up

Make sure you have Xcode installed and do an `npm install`.

Then do `npx expo run:ios` to build the development build and install in the Simulator.

Expo Go is not supported in this project because it is using `react-native-bottom-tabs` and requires some code that is not in Expo Go.
